"We went in for the pitch and sat down [with Peter Thiel] And Peter was just kind of like, 'Yeah, this is just a widgets business. Run this like any other business. You need to sell. You have product–market fit, you just need to maximize. Run the playbook: bring the customer in, make sure you're bringing them in cheaper.' He was basically like, 'This is a great lifestyle business, guys. Congrats.' And then we raised a bunch of venture, and it was a disaster"<br>

"We kept a lot of the same team. I think 4 of the core people at Soylent came over to Lucy, and that was basically our first 4 people. As we grew, we were definitely hiring for flexibility, because we knew there would be a pivot point where we'd move from DTC to retail. Having the ability to actually change how the business works over time and be flexible in that regard was important. We were also focused on people who were really, really good at leveraging existing tools. So we really tried to lean into the existing platforms and keep the company lean. Even today, I think we're still under 10 people. It's pretty small"<br>

"We started a second company, called Lucy, with the goal of helping people quit smoking. One of my co-founders was quitting smoking, and a lot of our friends were vaping. We knew that there were going to be people who wanted to quit. Nicorette wasn't really doing the job for a lot of people—they kind of saw it as more of a medicine. So we thought we could create a new nicotine gum, new nicotine products, to try and help people get off of the hardcore stuff like cigarettes."<br>

Everyone was saying it was massively overvalued, and I was kind of like, 'Hey, it doesn't matter. They're taking a big risk, they're taking a big shot. At $100M, yeah, it probably wound up being overvalued—but at the very least, just let them go and experiment.'"<br>

"During COVID, I was just bored and had free time for the first time in like a decade of entrepreneurship. But it was very clear that it was a time where, if you got louder online, you could actually make friends and meet new people. I just kind of thought it would be interesting to do the traditional take on 'Here's an opinion about technology' or 'Here's the history of a company,' but with more of a YouTube-native format. There were a couple of channels that would do something like 'The history of Apple,' but it was very much from an outsider's perspective"<br>

I didn't know what success looked like, because at the time, I was the only person in tech doing this. Garry Tan was around, but he was already huge. I wasn't even comparing myself to him. When I finally broke 100 views on a video, I was fired up. I was like, 'This one's a banger!' I just loved the process. I was learning motion graphics, spending hours in After Effects"<br>

First off, everyone likes looking at rockets, and Elon is also a household name.

That was the first time it went really, really big, because it was something that the mainstream media was talking about. Because I was in tech, I'd been talking about it with everyone months before. People in the space kind of knew there was going to be this VR resurgence. There was a discussion about it in tech, but it took a while until Zuck rebranded to Meta.
