He was having a few cigarettes whenever he'd get a drink with friends. His wife told him he's a smoker, but he, of course, insisted, 'No, I don't smoke all the time. I only smoke when I'm getting drinks with friends.' But she said, 'Yeah, but you get drinks with friends five nights a week. You're still smoking a bunch. So he started looking at the problem from a more scientific perspective"

                        "We started a second company, called Lucy, with the goal of helping people quit smoking. One of my co-founders was quitting smoking, and a lot of our friends were vaping. We knew that there were going to be people who wanted to quit. Nicorette wasn't really doing the job for a lot of people â€” they kind of saw it as more of a medicine. So we thought we could create a new nicotine gum, new nicotine products, to try and help people get off of the hardcore stuff like cigarettes."

I could start by interviewing every founder in the portfolio, or I could talk to all the partners and do something about who the team is.
